unsupervised learning
------
wikipedia explain:   
A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics
supervised learning intends to infer a conditional probability distribution 
conditioned on the label  of input data;unsupervised learning intends to infer an a priori probability distribution.

most common algorithms:
- clustering
- Anomaly detection
- Neural networks  (Autoencoders/ Deep Belief Nets/ Generative Adversarial Networks/ self-organizing map)
- latent variable models (Expectation-maximization algorithm, blind signal separation)

bind signal separation: the objective is to recover the original component signals from a mixture signal
