### GAN 
--------
need read the paper





### DCGAN (UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS)
-----
1. this paper guide how to train convolutional GAN, which have be more demonstrated by WGAN    

2. discriminatorâ€™s convolutional features as a feature extractor to evaluate the quality for unsupervised representation learning     

3. visualize the filters learnt by GANs and empirically show that specific filters have learned to draw specific objects    

4. generators have interesting vector arithmetic properties allowing for easy manipulation of many semantic qualities of generated samples
